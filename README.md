### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "ncdc_covid19_dataset.csv" file from ** https://ncdc.gov.ng/ncdc** contained detailed information about each COVID-19 in Nigeria.

### Tools 

- Power Query - Data Cleaning
- Power BI - Data Analysis
- Power BI - Creating Reporting

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task:

1.	Loading data on Power query
2.	Inspection and aligning
3.	Data cleaning and formatting
4.	Loading data for Analyzing
5.	Create new measures

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the NCDC COVID-19 data to answer key question such as:

- Total death case in Nigeria by state
- Which state has the highest death case
- Which state has the admission cases
- Which state has the lowest admission case
- Which state has the highest discharged case
- Which state has the lowest discharged case
- What number of cases confirmed by Lab
- What is the total discharge 


### Data Analysis

Include some interesting formal worked with

``` 
Power BI
-	No of State = COUNT('Table 1'[States Affected])

```

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follow:
1. Lagos state has the highest number of death with 771 date cases followed by Edo with 322, while kogi has the lowest with just 2 death cases
2. Report shows that Lagos has the highest discharge with 102k discharged patient while Kogi has the lowest with 3 discharge 
3. Result shows that Lagos State was badly hit based on the numbers of deaths and discharged from admission.

### Recommendation

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Lagos should always preparing for emergency outbreak of deadly diseases with available space for quarantine   
- Nigeria should equipped her NCDC with appropriate resources need for vaccines research in other to prepare for future emergency deadly diseases outbreak in the future 
- Nigeria government should establish quick emergency response unit in each state capital and equipped with resource need to stand against any disease outbreak  

### Limitations
So many data on the COVID-19 which i was nearly confused and if I have used such data, It would affected my analysis.
